2.  Fill in your **Name**, **Email**, and **Password**.
3.  Click the **"Sign Up"** button.
4.  You'll see a "Success" message if registration is successful, or an alert if inputs are missing or the email already exists.

2.  Enter your registered **Email** and **Password**.
3.  Click the **"Login"** button.
4.  If credentials are correct, you will be redirected to the `home.html` welcome page. If incorrect, an "Incorrect Info" alert will appear.

### Logout
